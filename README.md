🧠 Online Store Logic Model (Prolog)

A small Prolog project that models an online electronics store using facts, rules and simple logical inference.

Tech: Prolog • Logical Programming • Recursion • Lists • Cut/Fail

What it includes:
	•	Product database (facts)
	•	Rules for:
	•	cheap products
	•	price categorization
	•	budget-based recommendations
	•	Recursive total price calculator
	•	Filtering logic for cheap items
	•	Five sample queries (goals)

Purpose: Demonstrates core concepts in Prolog — facts, rules, recursion, pattern matching and control using cut/fail.
